                <h1>Lakes</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="random_border">A lake is a naturally occurring, relatively large and fixed body of water on the
                earth's surface. It is localized in a basin or interconnected basins surrounded by dry land.[1] Lakes
                lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they form
                part of the Earth's water cycle by serving as large standing pools of storage water. Most lakes are
                freshwater and account for almost all the world's surface freshwater, but some are salt lakes with
                salinities even higher than that of seawater. Lakes vary significantly in surface area and volume.

                Lakes are typically much larger and deeper than ponds, which are also water-filled basins on land,
                although there are no official definitions or scientific criteria distinguishing the two.[2] and lakes
                are also distinct from lagoons, which are shallow tidal pools dammed by sandbars at coastal regions of
                oceans or large lakes. Most lakes are fed by springs, and both fed and drained by creeks and rivers, but
                some lakes are endorheic without any outflow, while volcanic lakes are filled directly by precipitation
                runoffs and do not have any inflow streams.[3]

                Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas (i.e. alpine lakes), dormant volcanic craters,
                rift zones and areas with ongoing glaciation. Other lakes are found in depressed landforms or along the
                courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened over a basin formed by eroded floodplains
                and wetlands. Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns left over
                from the last ice age. All lakes are temporary over long periods of time, as they will slowly fill in
                with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

                Artificially controlled lakes are known as reservoirs, and are usually constructed for industrial or
                agricultural use, for hydroelectric power generation, for supplying domestic drinking water, for
                ecological or recreational purposes, or for other human activities.

                Etymology, meaning, and usage of "lake"
                The word lake comes from Middle English lake ('lake, pond, waterway'), from Old English lacu ('pond,
                pool, stream'), from Proto-Germanic *lakō ('pond, ditch, slow moving stream'), from the
                Proto-Indo-European root *leǵ- ('to leak, drain'). Cognates include Dutch laak ('lake, pond, ditch'),
                Middle Low German lāke ('water pooled in a riverbed, puddle') as in: de:Wolfslake, de:Butterlake, German
                Lache ('pool, puddle'), and Icelandic lækur ('slow flowing stream'). Also related are the English words
                leak and leach.

                There is considerable uncertainty about defining the difference between lakes and ponds, and neither
                term has an internationally accepted definition across scientific disciplines or political
                boundaries.[4] For example, limnologists have defined lakes as water bodies that are simply a larger
                version of a pond, which can have wave action on the shoreline or where wind-induced turbulence plays a
                major role in mixing the water column. None of these definitions completely excludes ponds and all are
                difficult to measure. For this reason, simple size-based definitions are increasingly used to separate
                ponds and lakes. Definitions for lake range in minimum sizes for a body of water from 2 hectares (5
                acres)[5]: 331 [6] to 8 hectares (20 acres).[7] Pioneering animal ecologist Charles Elton regarded lakes
                as waterbodies of 40 hectares (99 acres) or more.[8] The term lake is also used to describe a feature
                such as Lake Eyre, which is a dry basin most of the time but may become filled under seasonal conditions
                of heavy rainfall. In common usage, many lakes bear names ending with the word pond, and a lesser number
                of names ending with lake are, in quasi-technical fact, ponds. One textbook illustrates this point with
                the following: "In Newfoundland, for example, almost every lake is called a pond, whereas in Wisconsin,
                almost every pond is called a lake."[9]

                One hydrology book proposes to define the term "lake" as a body of water with the following five
                characteristics:[4]

                It partially or totally fills one or several basins connected by straits;
                It has essentially the same water level in all parts (except for relatively short-lived variations
                caused by wind, varying ice cover, large inflows, etc.);
                It does not have regular intrusion of seawater;
                A considerable portion of the sediment suspended in the water is captured by the basins (for this to
                happen they need to have a sufficiently small inflow-to-volume ratio);
                The area measured at the mean water level exceeds an arbitrarily chosen threshold (for instance, one
                hectare).
                With the exception of criterion 3, the others have been accepted or elaborated upon by other hydrology
                publications.[10][11]

                Distribution

                Lake Eyre's shape and depth as a gradient map
                The majority of lakes on Earth are freshwater, and most lie in the Northern Hemisphere at higher
                latitudes.[12] Canada, with a deranged drainage system, has an estimated 31,752 lakes larger than 3
                square kilometres (1.2 sq mi) in surface area.[13] The total number of lakes in Canada is unknown but is
                estimated to be at least 2 million.[14] Finland has 168,000 lakes of 500 square metres (5,400 sq ft) in
                area, or larger, of which 57,000 are large (10,000 square metres (110,000 sq ft) or larger).[15]

                Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or stream, which maintain a lake's
                average level by allowing the drainage of excess water.[3][16] Some lakes do not have a natural outflow
                and lose water solely by evaporation or underground seepage, or both. These are termed endorheic lakes.

                Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for hydroelectric power generation, aesthetic purposes,
                recreational purposes, industrial use, agricultural use, or domestic water supply.

                The number of lakes on Earth is undetermined because most lakes and ponds are very small and do not
                appear on maps or satellite imagery.[17][18][19][20] Despite this uncertainty, a large number of studies
                agree that small ponds are much more abundant than large lakes. For example, one widely cited study
                estimated that Earth has 304 million lakes and ponds, and that 91% of these are 1 hectare (2.5 acres) or
                less in area.[17] Despite the overwhelming abundance of ponds, almost all of Earth's lake water is found
                in fewer than 100 large lakes; this is because lake volume scales superlinearly with lake area.[21]

                Extraterrestrial lakes exist on the moon Titan, which orbits the planet Saturn.[22] The shape of lakes
                on Titan is very similar to those on Earth.[19][23][24] Lakes were formerly present on the surface of
                Mars, but are now dry lake beds.
